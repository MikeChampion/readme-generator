## <a id="description">I. Description</a>

This project was built to help simplify creating a README file for any future projects.
By using this I can create the basic structure of my README by answering the prompts, so I can spend less time formatting and trying to remember what needs to be added. I learned a bit more about how markdown works with this project, and got to use the NodeJS Inquirer package for the first time (in a real project).

## <a id="install-instructions">II. Install Instructions</a>

Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine. If you don't have Inquirer installed you will need to do that (Open the terminal and run 'npm i').

## <a id="usage-information">III. Usage Information</a>

Open the terminal and run this using 'node index.js'. You'll be presented with a series of prompts, gathering information to build your README. Once all prompts are answered you'll have a brand new README that you can copy and paste into your new project. The generated README will be in 'assets/js/', this is the one you should copy/paste. Please leave the README in the root directory (this README) for reference.
